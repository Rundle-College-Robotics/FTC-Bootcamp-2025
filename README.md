# FTC Bootcamp 2025
This is where you will find all pre-written code needed for FTC.

If you don't know what Git or GitHub is, don't worry. Think of it like Google Drive but for programmers.
You won't need Git for this bootcamp, but if you are curious, it's worth learning! Git is used by most professional programmers and lets you skip emailing each other code.
